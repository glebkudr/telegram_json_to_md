# Implementation Plan - Telegram HTML to Markdown Parser

## Problem Statement
Create a desktop application that processes Telegram HTML export files and converts them into clean Markdown format. The app should handle large files (up to 50MB) efficiently with background processing and real-time progress tracking.

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Core Structure
- [x] Create design documents (architecture.md, tasks.md)
- [ ] Initialize Wails project structure
- [ ] Setup Go modules and dependencies
- [ ] Configure Vue + Vite frontend
- [ ] Create basic app structure with Context bridge

## Phase 2: Backend Core Services
- [ ] Implement data models (Progress, FileInfo, ProcessResult)
- [ ] Create file operations service (directory scanning, validation)
- [ ] Develop HTML parser with Markdown conversion
- [ ] Implement progress tracking system
- [ ] Add error handling and logging

## Phase 3: Background Processing
- [ ] Implement goroutine-based file processing
- [ ] Add progress reporting mechanism
- [ ] Create cancellation support
- [ ] Implement concurrent file processing with limits
- [ ] Add memory-efficient streaming for large files

## Phase 4: Frontend Development
- [ ] Create directory selection component
- [ ] Implement progress bar visualization
- [ ] Add file processing status display
- [ ] Create error notification system
- [ ] Build results summary view

## Phase 5: Integration & Testing
- [ ] Connect frontend with backend services
- [ ] Test with various HTML file formats
- [ ] Performance testing with large files
- [ ] Error scenario testing
- [ ] User acceptance testing

## Phase 6: Polish & Deployment
- [ ] Add application icons and branding
- [ ] Optimize performance and memory usage
- [ ] Create build configurations
- [ ] Documentation and user guide
- [ ] Final testing and bug fixes

## Technical Tasks Breakdown

### Backend Components
1. **Models Package** (`internal/models/`)

   - Progress struct  
   - ProcessResult struct
   - Error types

2. **File Operations** (`internal/fileops/`)
   - Directory scanner
   - File validator
   - Path utilities
   - Disk space checker

3. **HTML Parser** (`internal/parser/`)
   - HTML tokenizer
   - Markdown converter
   - Content cleaner
   - Character encoding handler

4. **App Service** (`app.go`)
   - Wails context methods
   - File processing orchestration
   - Progress event emission
   - Error handling

### Frontend Components  
1. **Directory Selector**
   - Native directory picker integration
   - Path validation display

2. **Progress Visualization**
   - Progress bar component
   - File-by-file status
   - Overall completion tracking

3. **Status Display**
   - Current operation indicator
   - Error messages
